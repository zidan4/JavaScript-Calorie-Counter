# JavaScript-Calorie-Counter

freeCodeCamp Practice Project 3.

JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures.



 In this calorie counter project, I learnt how to validate user input, perform calculations based on that input, and dynamically update the interface to display the results.

In this practice project, I learn basic regular expressions, template literals, the addEventListener() method, and more.
